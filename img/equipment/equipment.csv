	Canon EF 75-300mm	"The Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM Lens is a relatively small, very light and very cheap lens for this focal length range.
And the 75-300 III really is cheap. You usually get what you pay for - unfortunately this is the case with the 75-300 III."	GeoLab	1	CANON75-300MM.jpg
	Canon EF-S 18-55mm	The Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II Lens is the review-time-current version of Canon's least expensive APS-C DSLR kit lens (replacing the EF-S 18-55mm IS Lens). While it is designed as a starter lens and leaves a lot to be desired, it is a good value when purchased in a kit. It is cheap, small and extremely light, has image stabilization and has a nice general purpose focal length range.	GeoLab	1	CANON18-55MM.jpg
